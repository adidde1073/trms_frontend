<h6>Overview:</h6>
<p>
TRMS provides a system that encourages quality knowledge growth relevant to an individualâ€™s expertise
as a reimbursement application for university courses, seminars, certification preparation classes,
certifications, and technical training. The current system relies solely on email communication,
requiring manual lookups of available funds, and is error-prone due to inbox clutter and incorrect
routing of tasks. Furthermore, there is no way to record and report on reimbursements awarded, and
so the company has no way to identify highly-invested courses that could be developed to be offered in-house.
TRMS is the solution.
